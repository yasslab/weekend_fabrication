# What's Weekend Fabrication course? (en)

Weekend Fabrication is a lean-startup-based course that 
teaches students in Okinawa about how to make web/mobile 
applications and English, where students need to 
1) implement something he/she wants, 2) show it to others, 
and 3) decide what to create/update/delete in the next week. 

All students taking this course repeats this process every week.
At the end of the term, they will give presentations of their
final product(s) in English to the media in Okinawa.

This course is now integrated with [Lexues Academy](http://academy.lexues.co.jp/seminar/making.php).
